# application express

*Application Express is a rapid web application development tool for developing and deploying professional applications. Application Express has more limited object-creation features than SQL Developer, but Application Express allows you to create form-based applications quickly. This guide includes sections that explain how to create such an application.*

*Application Express is packaged with Oracle Database Express Edition, so no separate download or installation is needed.*
