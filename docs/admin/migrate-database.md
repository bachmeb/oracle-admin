# migrate database

*Migration is the process of copying the schema objects and data from a source third-party (non-Oracle) database, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server, or Microsoft Access, to an Oracle database. You can perform the migration in an efficient, largely automated way. Thus, you have two options for working with third-party databases in SQL Developer: 1. Creating database connections so that you can view schema objects and data in these databases. 2. Migrating these databases to Oracle, to take advantage of the full range of Oracle Database features and capabilities.* (https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/doc.112/e12152/migration.htm)
